# NFA TOKEN


NotFair is not merely a project but an experiment within the zkFair ecosystem. There are no VC institutions or team shares involved; all tokens will be distributed equitably and allocated to the community, marking just the initial phase. The creators of the NotFair token constitute a group of individuals passionate about ZKFAIR who aspire to collaborate with the community in developing a solid ecosystem using Web3 technologies."

“How to start

As previously mentioned, the initial phase of the NotFair protocol involves the equitable and decentralized distribution of $NFA to community members.

An important reminder: the maximum amount of tokens per wallet is limited to 1% of the total supply


# Tokenomics

Token Introduction

$NFA is the most decentralized MEME Token on the most decentralized L2 blockchain zkFair

Total Supply

500,000,000,000 tokens.


# Distribution Method

In the initial stage of NotFair, 80% of $NFA tokens will be deposited into the NFA-USDC pool, in the ratio of 400,000,000,000 tokens

80% of the total NFA amount will be directly contributed to the NFA-USDC pool.

20% of the total NFA amount will be allocated to support community initiatives, partnerships, and further development of the $NFA Token ecosystem.

To preserve NotFair's decentralization, a purchase volume limit of a maximum of 1% of the entire NFA emission per wallet has been implemented.
This way we can build a truly free community.”
